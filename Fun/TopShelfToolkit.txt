With usage of this module, you will gain the ability to ... *list*

When it comes to just wanting to be a general, all-around, passed many a checkered 
flag for first place at everything, type of person..?

Like Ricky Bobby says a bunch of times in the classic hit-movie, Talledaga Nights...
"If you're not first..? Tou're last..."

They're words to live by. And guess what...? 
This module is dedicated to the people that keep trying to race this dude anyway.

Sit back and think about the type of person you'd have to start out with, to merely
meet the description I just said. 

We're talkin... coming from a rather high-shelf, with an endless array of 
category 5 hurricanes on their mind. On a daily basis... for years. 
Clever, engineering marvel, master extraordinaires...

Some of them might even be war torn veterans who have seen a lot... done a lot. 
Calculated about as many functions, as they've had to snap a neck or two... 
...which is why they're the assassin grade programmers that everyone should be 
worried about.

Whether they are literally or metaphorically that good..? 
Well, snapping necks and cashing checks is in their MO.

Maybe these war torn veterans have some stories that turn even the most 
rock-hearted, brute force men that could pull a garbage truck by a rope... 
...into a bunch of weepy little girls.

Stories that even though you or anyone else may have heard before? 
Well, the *way* that they tell this story never gets old. 
Everybody might actually try to walk out of the room as quickly as possible... 
BEFORE they go on yet another "Did I ever tell you the story about the time...?"

Because everybody knows, that as soon as those words come out of the veterans mouth...
...it's the beginning of a 3 day adventure where you're literally climbing over rocks
and digging through the sand with your toes. You thought it was just another day at
the office, but no... 

You're just getting paid to stand there and listen to this person's life story... 
...from the reflection pools of Washington DC, to the Louisiana Bayou, or Grand Canyon... 
Maybe even wading through waist-high-water flash floods from torrential asian monsoons... 
...having to carry your best friend to safety while he's dying...

Maybe Tom Clancy could have a major involvement in the writing of the book, about
the series of events based on these people in particular... 

Maybe there's an instance where Tom Clancy already got up one day after hearing about 
this story taking place... and said "Hey, I want to write a book about this."

Perhaps the character Tom Clancy had in mind for this extension of the story... 
...as a direct result of observing these category 5 hurricaine strategy masters out there... 
...a character based on none other than the real person that Tom Clancy thought'd be perfect-
...to recruit as an acting replacement for Tom Cruise.

He figured, "Mr. Cruise is in all 14 Mission Impossible movies.",
and then "Tom sorta has an acting monopoly on good spy operative movies..."
Mission Impossible, Jack Reacher... 

It is pretty easy to see how he's 'first place' material though... 
Losing Goose in Top Gun really drew out the perfect storm for Tom Cruises acting
abilities to take root...
...only to then manifest into the much more mature version of the character that the man
can, blindfolded, handcuffed, whatever... tap into on command.
All cause his best buddy Goose died.

I heard that Tom took it really hard when he lost Goose.
Not Tom Clancy... Tom Cruise. I gotta say... 
I think that losing Goose could traumatize anybody, let alone any hardened warrior/soldier...

Now, look... 
What I've just spent the last few paragraphs stating...
...that's just a *preview* of the level I will have to rise to... 
...in order to merely *describe*... 
...the type of person who could fill Tom Cruises shoes any day of the week.

It's a tall order, I know. But- Tom Clancy knows who that person is.
Because while Tom Cruise *acts* like he's a super secret top notch spy..?

Well, the people that *this module* is written for, and dedicated to...?

They're the type of people that *could* call their spy buddies that live down the street. 
To keep tabs on you, anywhere/everywhere..? But- they don't. 

They could also just out of nowhere, take a vacation whenever, wherever, go, see, 
do... at the drop of a pin... but- they don't do that either. Why...?

- long pause -

Because they're too busy being awesome. That's why.

So what you're left with after all is said and done, is a description of the type of 
grade/character of somebody who should have gotten a Nobel Peace Prize by now. 
And in this specific (person/people)'s case, it just so happens to be...

...that it is actually possible to be considered too peaceful to receive a Nobel
Peace Prize. It's like what I'd imagine a director at the Oscars goes through when 
they get 'snubbed' for an Academy Award/Oscar.

Some people have done plenty of things to get this thing, and yet- 
...the prize continues to be given to Suzy Q down the street. 

Now, you say to yourself, "That's odd... I know who that girl is." 
Turns out, she read this dude's Facebook posts every day.
Miraculously, it led to her getting a Nobel Peace Prize.

I'm not saying that there IS a specific case of this having happened to 
(person/persons)... but maybe I am.

Whatever the case may be... Perhaps a lot of Nobel Peace Prize snubbings have 
occurred. So maybe there is an underground, back stage version of events, 
where (that person/those people) *definitely* won at least 12 of them by 
now. 

You'd think it'd upset them that they can't go around telling people... 

[ Tangent : Skit ]=================================================================

You: "Yeah I've got 12 of those." you announce, like a king.
*A person hears you, waits a second.* 
*They didn't think you were talking to them, and the delay is noticed, 
causing the conversation to begin awkwardly.*

Person: "Uh.. Ok? What are you telling *me* for? 12 what?"
You: "Ah. I knew you'd ask. Nobel Peace Prizes." *you announce like a king*
*The person you just said that to, they're confused.*
Person: "Wait, huh?"
You: "You asked me 12 what. Nobel Peace Prizes... that's what."
Person: "I... didn't think that was possible. Sounds like you're making that up."
You: "No, I'm not."
Person: "You've got 12 Nobel Peace Prizes?"
You: "Yes." *you announce like a king*
Person: "12 of them?"
You: "Yeah man."

[ End Skit ]========================================================================

This is the module that hopes to attempt to be...
...one that was specifically tailor made for the limited few people in this world 
that happen to have an array of constant category 5 hurricanes going on in their 
mind every day, and yet- they're as peaceful as can be.

Getting snubbed for that many peace prizes should send any sane man that deserves 
one, over the edge. I just... don't know how they do it. 

Being told that you're too peaceful to receive a Nobel Peace Prize?
Is it worse than never actually getting one, and everybody fake saying 
"You'll get one someday buddy!"

What I just described, it *should* be enough to drive any one of these people I 
just described... into a frenzy.

Maybe they deserve this prize. 
Perhaps they have put less thought into it than I have, but... 
....now they realize they don't have a Nobel Peace Prize.
*Now* they're sitting there thinking "Yeah actually... What gives?"

I could imagine, in a much less sarcastic tone... that some rich goodie two shoes 
saying to themselves... "I've got plenty of money folks. All that time... the 
money wasn't even what I wanted. 
People kept giving it to me anyway, so... wasn't gonna turn that down.

I was so friggen skilled at doing what I did to become rich and famous... 
I eventually got bored of destroying my best records. 
So... I started going around helping OTHER people in need. 
Gave myself an even more difficult challenge. 

However... all my good deeds aside...? 
The world has largely ignored the one need that I still have to this day...
That is...? 

My need to receive one of these peace prizes."

You might think i'm just kidding, or that I'm making up a really unbelievable 
situation... 

But you would be shocked at how much of this is an accurate story... about the 
guy that this module was written for. Well, everyone else too.

Maybe this guy earned it fair and square. 
20 times over, even... 
And yet...? 
The man unable to obtain this prize... 

He and his wife have changed the world... but- still no Nobel Peace Prize.
Once everybody realizes how messed up that is... they'll understand what I 
had to live through to write this thing.

[Final Thought]
FightingEntropy might not be that extreme, where it winds up earning a Nobel
Peace Prize or anything like that...
But it'll help people feel less salty over time.

It could eventually help build a new generation of smart people...
