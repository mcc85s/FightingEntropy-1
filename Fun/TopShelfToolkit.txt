With usage of this module, you will gain the ability to ... *list*

When it comes to just wanting to be a general, all-around, passed many a checkered 
flag for first place at everything, type of person..?

Like Ricky Bobby says a bunch of times in the classic hit-movie, Talledaga Nights...
"If you're not first..? You're last..."

They're words to live by. And guess what...? 
This module is dedicated to the people that keep trying to race this dude anyway.

Sit back and think about the type of person you'd have to start out with, to merely
meet the description I just said. 

We're talkin'... coming from a rather high class, top-shelf quality with an endless 
array of category 5 hurricanes on their mind. On a daily basis... for years. 
Clever, engineering marvel, master extraordinaires...

Someone meeting this description might even be a war torn veteran who's seen a lot...
...done a lot. Calculated about as many functions, as they've had to snap a neck or 
two- which is why they're the 'assassin-grade' programmers that everyone should be 
worried about.

Whether they are _literally_ or _metaphorically_ that good..? Well, you don't have to 
watch Step Brothers, to know that snapping necks and cashing checks is their MO.

Maybe this war torn veteran has some stories that turn even the most rock-hearted, 
brute force men that could pull a garbage truck by a rope... 
...into a bunch of weepy little girls after a sad movie at a sleepover party.

Stories that even though people have already heard before? 
Well, the *way* that they tell this story never gets old. Nope.
They start rattling off with "Did I ever tell you the story about the time...?"
...everybody tries to walk out of the room as quickly as possible... 

Because everybody knows, that as soon as those words come out of the veterans mouth...
...it's the beginning of a 3 day adventure where they're literally climbing over 
rocks, digging through the sand with their toes, smelling the fresh scent of the sea. 

You thought it was just another day at the office, but no... 
You're just getting paid to stand there and listen to this person's life story... 
...from the reflection pools of Washington DC, to the Louisiana Bayou, or Grand Canyon... 
Maybe even wading through waist-high-water flash floods from torrential asian monsoons... 
...having to carry your best friend to safety while he's dying.

Maybe Tom Clancy could have a major involvement in the writing of the book, about
the series of events that this war torn veteran lived through... albeit barely. 

Maybe there's an instance where Tom Clancy already got up one day after hearing about 
this story taking place... and said "Hey, I want to write a book about this."

Perhaps the character Tom Clancy had in mind for this extension of the veterans' story... 
...as a direct result of observing this category-5-hurricaine-strategy-master at work...  
...a character based on none other than the real person that Tom Clancy thought'd be perfect-
...to recruit as an acting replacement for Tom Cruise.

He figured, "Mr. Cruise is in all 14 Mission Impossible movies. Sorta has an acting monopoly
on good spy operative movies...". Mission Impossible, Jack Reacher, Edge of Tomorrow... 

It is pretty easy to see how he's 'first place' material though.
Losing Goose in Top Gun really drew out the perfect storm for Tom Cruises acting
abilities to take root...
...only to then manifest into the much more mature version of the character that the man
can, blindfolded, handcuffed, whatever... tap into on command.
All cause his best buddy Goose died.

I heard that Tom took it really hard when he lost Goose.
Not Tom Clancy... Tom Cruise. I gotta say... 
I think that losing Goose could traumatize anybody, let alone any hardened warrior/soldier...

Now, look... 
What I've just spent the last few paragraphs stating...
...that's just a *preview* of the level I will have to rise to... 
...in order to merely *describe*... 
...the type of person who could fill Tom Cruises shoes any day of the week.

It's a tall order, I know. But- Tom Clancy knows who that person is.
Because while Tom Cruise *acts* like he's a super secret top notch spy..?

Well, the people that *this module* is written for, and dedicated to...?
They're the type of people that *could* call their spy buddies that live down the street. 
To keep tabs on you, anywhere/everywhere..? But- they don't. 

They could also just out of nowhere, take a vacation whenever, wherever, go, see, 
do... at the drop of a pin... but- they don't do that either. Why...?

- long pause -

Because they're too busy being awesome. That's why.

So what you're left with after all is said and done, is a description of the type of 
grade/character of somebody who *should've* gotten a Nobel Peace Prize by now...
...but, hasn't. Not yet.
 
And in this specific (person/people)'s case, it just so happens to be...
...that it may actually be possible, to be considered 'too peaceful' to receive a Nobel
Peace Prize. It's like what I'd imagine a director at the Oscars goes through when 
they get 'snubbed' for an Academy Award/Oscar.

Some people have done plenty of things to get this thing, and yet- 
...the prize continues to be given to Suzy Q down the street. 

Now, you say to yourself, "That's odd... I know who that girl is." 
Turns out, she read this dude's Facebook posts every day.
Miraculously, it led to her getting a Nobel Peace Prize.

I'm not saying that there IS a specific case of this having happened to 
(person/persons)... but maybe I am.

Whatever the case may be... 
Perhaps a lot of Nobel Peace Prize snubbings have occurred.
And this war torn veteran who's literally and metaphorically bled for this country, 
and its flag...? 

It led to the myth of an underground, back stage version of events, where (that 
person/those people) *definitely* won at least 12 of them by now. 

You'd think it'd upset them that they can't go around telling people... 

[ Tangent : Skit ]=================================================================

You: "Yeah I've got 12 of those." *you announce like a king*
*A person hears you, but waits a moment* 
*They didn't think you were talking to them, and the delay is noticed...* 
*So the conversation begins awkwardly*

Person: Uh.. Ok? What are you telling *me* for? 12 what?
You: Ah. I knew you'd ask... Nobel Peace Prizes. *you announce like a king*
*The person you just said that to, is confused*
Person: Wait, huh?
You: You asked me 12 what. Nobel Peace Prizes... that's what.
Person: I... didn't think that was possible.
You: It is possible.
Person: Sounds like you're making that up.
You: No, I'm not.
Person: You've got 12 Nobel Peace Prizes?
You: Yes. *you announce like a king*
Person: 12 of them?
You: Yeah man.

[ End Skit ]========================================================================

...and it probably does upset them.

Despite of all of this, this is the module that hopes to be...
...considered 'pretty good after all', to the war torn veteran that it was written 
for. Well, everyone else too.

It is specifically tailor-made, for the limited few people in this world that happen
to have an array of constant category-5-hurricanes going on in their mind, every day- 
and yet they remain as peaceful as can be.

I just don't know how they do it. Getting snubbed for that many peace prizes should 
send any sane man that deserves one, over the edge.

Being told that you're too peaceful to receive a Nobel Peace Prize?
Is it worse than never actually getting one, and everybody saying... 
Everybody: You'll get one someday buddy~!

What I just described, it *should* be enough to drive any one of these people I 
just described... into a frenzy. Maybe they deserve this prize.
 
Perhaps they have put less thought into it than I have, but... 
....now after reading all of this, they realize they don't have a Nobel Peace Prize.

Now they're sitting there thinking... 
War-torn veteran: Yeah actually... What gives?

In a much less sarcastic tone...
A guy that has never worn a pair of bad shoes in his life kept saying to himself...

War-torn veteran: I've got plenty of money folks. All that time... the money wasn't 
even what I wanted. People kept giving it to me anyway, so... 
wasn't gonna turn that down.

War-torn veteran: I was so skilled at doing what I did to become rich and famous... 
I eventually got bored of destroying my best records. As such, I started going around 
helping OTHER people in need. Gave myself an even more difficult challenge. All my good
deeds aside...? The world has largely ignored the one need that I still have. 
To this day... I've still not gotten this highly respected peace prize.

Now look. You might think i'm just kidding, or that I'm making up a really unbelievable 
situation... But you would be shocked at how much of this is an accurate story about the 
guy that this module was written for. Well, everyone else too.

Maybe this guy has earned it fair and square, 20 times over, and yet...? 
The man remains unable to obtain this prize... 

He and his wife have changed the world. But- still no Nobel Peace Prize.

Once everybody realizes how messed up that is...? 
Then maybbe they'll understand what I had to live through to write this thing.

[Final Thought]

FightingEntropy might not be that extreme, where it winds up earning anybody a Nobel
Peace Prize or anything like that...

But, it could help people feel less salty over time, in the form of helping to build a 
new generation of smart people...
