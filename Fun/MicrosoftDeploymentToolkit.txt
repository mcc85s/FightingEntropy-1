It is *the* toolkit...
...that Microsoft themselves uses...
...to deploy additional toolkits.

It's not that weird.
You're just thinking way too far into it, honestly.

Regardless... it is quite a fearsome toolkit to have in one's pocket.
Or, wherever really...
...at any given time.

When you need to be taken seriously...?
Well, it *should* be the first choice on one's agenda.
But that's up to you.

The [Microsoft Deployment Toolkit].
Even Mr. Gates thinks it's awesome.
